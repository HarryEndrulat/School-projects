1. WHY DOESN'T THE LOOP ON LINES 24-30 OF ARCHIE'S FIRST PROGRAM ALWAYS EXECUTE?
	"int i;" inside count is a non-static variable. This means it could really be initialized to anything, just by chance sometimes it is initialized to 0



2. ARCHIE'S CODE CAN BE FIXED BY CHANGING ONE LINE. IT CAN ALSO BE FIXED BY
   INSERTING ONE LINE. WHAT LINE CAN BE CHANGED TO FIX THE BUG, AND WHAT SHOULD
   THE LINE BE CHANGED TO? (ALTERNATIVELY, WHAT LINE OF CODE CAN YOU INSERT TO
   FIX THE BUG, AND WHERE SHOULD THAT LINE GO?)
	line 16 modifies the value at the address "result" to 6 which sum is still pointing to. i don't know how to do this in one line.


3. WHY DOES *sum - *product ON LINE 25 OF ARCHIE'S SECOND PROGRAM PRODUCE THE
   VALUE 0?
	line 16 modifies the value at the address "result" to 6 which sum is also pinting to. *sum and *product are pointing to the same address
