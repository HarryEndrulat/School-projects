1. WHAT IS THE MICROCONTROLLER'S CLOCK PERIOD, IN MICROSECONDS?
1 cycle per .0625 microseconds


2. WHAT IS THE REPORTED TIME REQUIRED TO ACCESS DATA IN A CPU REGISTER?  
.00014 microseconds per read


3. WHAT CAN YOU CONCLUDE ABOUT THE TIME REUQIRED TO ACCESS DATA IN A CPU
   REGISTER? IS THE REPORTED TIME SIGNIFICANT?
Accessing data in the CPU register is REALLY fast. Magnitudes faster than the clock cycle,
446 could occur within 1 clock period. the reported time is rather insignificant.

4. WHAT IS THE REPORTED TIME REQUIRED TO ACCESS DATA IN SRAM?
.12584 microseconds per read


5. IS THE REPORTED TIME REQUIRED TO ACCESS DATA IN SRAM CONSISTENT WITH
   INFORMATION IN THE ATmega328P DATA SHEET? EXPLAIN WHY OR WHY NOT.
Yes it is. a clock cycle is .0625 microseconds and the data sheet says SRAM access takes
2 clock cycles. .0625*2 = 0.125 microseconds, very close to the reported time.


6. WHAT IS THE REPORTED TIME REQUIRED TO ACCESS DATA IN FLASH MEMORY?
.40335 microseconds per read


7. HOW MANY CLOCK CYCLES ARE REQUIRED TO ACCESS DATA IN FLASH MEMORY?
.40335/.0625 = 6.4536 clock cycles per flash memory access


8. WHAT CAN YOU CONCLUDE ABOUT THE RELATIVE SPEEDS OF SRAM AND FLASH MEMORY?
relatively expensive in relation to the time taken to access data in a CPU register.
CPU register access is preferred to SRAM access ir preferred to Flash memory access.

9. WHAT IS YOUR ESTIMATE FOR THE SIZE OF THE INTEL XEON'S L1 CACHE?
32KB


10. WHAT IS YOUR ESTIMATE FOR THE SIZE OF THE INTEL XEON'S L2 CACHE?
192KB


11. WHAT IS YOUR ESTIMATE FOR THE SIZE OF THE INTEL XEON'S L3 CACHE?
8MB


12. ARE YOU PROVIDING AN ESTIMATE FOR THE SIZE OF A CACHE LINE FOR THE INTEL
    XEON OR FOR THE INTEL CORE i7?
Intel Xeon


13. WHAT IS YOUR ESTIMATE FOR THE SIZE OF A CACHE LINE IN THE PROCESSOR THAT
    YOU IDENTIFIED IN QUESTION 12?
8 bytes
